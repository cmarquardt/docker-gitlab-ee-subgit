# gitlab-ee-subgit

Docker image: [marq/gitlab-ee-subgit](https://hub.docker.com/r/marq/gitlab-ee-subgit/)

[GitLab](http://gitlab.org)'s Enterprise Edition, with [SubGit](http://www.subgit.com) v3.3.5 installed and `cron` running.

All of [GitLab's Docker-related documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/) remains valid; the only difference compared to the [official Docker image(s)](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ee/) provided by GitLab HQ is that this image contains an installation of SubGit, a tool for migrating and even mirroring subversion and git source code repositories. In addition, one more volume (`/etc/subgit`) is exposed, allowing to store SubGit related  things like a license key. Finally, the `cron` daemon is started up upon launching the image, and the corresponding system directory `/etc/cron.d` is also exported 

[Subgit's SVN to Gitlab Howto](http://www.subgit.com/gitlab.html) is a worthwhile read. Note that his Docker image only contains the SubGit software, but no configuration or license files for it.

## Volumes

`/etc/gitlab`: Configuration of the GitLab server

`/var/opt/gitlab`: Repositories

`/var/log/gitlab`: Logfiles

`/etc/subgit`: Location for subgit.key (if available, SubGit will find it there)

`/etc/cron.d`: Location for cron jobs (e.g., backups)

## Usage

For GitLab itself, see http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/.

For SubGit and Gitlab, see http://www.subgit.com/gitlab.html.

In contrast to the original image, the cron daemon is also launched when starting up GitLab. This allows processing of cron jobs added to `/etc/cron.d`. However, no cron obs are provided as part of this image.

## GitLab Versions and Tags

The images are in general tagged with the GitLab version they are based on, and follow the name naming scheme as the official releases, but do not include release candidates. I handle these versioned tags manually; should I forget to update them, please raise a ticket at github. Thanks!  

Finally, images with the `:latest` tag are automatically build from the official GitLab repository whenever Gitlab HQ decides to push a new (even experimental) image. 
 

## SubGit Versions

Present images are using Subgit v3.3.5 (actually since v9.5.2 of GitLab), as does the `:latest` one.

For older images, previous SubGit versions were used. In particular:

 - GitLab v9.0 up to v9.5.1: SubGit v3.2.5
 - GitLab v8.11 up to v8.17.8: SubGit v3.2.2 
  
For a while, I was maintaining alternate images with the older v3.0.0 of SubGit included. The images can be distinguished by their tags, e.g.:

    gitlab-ee-subgit:8.11.0-ee.1:        GitLab v8.11.0 (EE), SubGit v3.2.2
    gitlab-ee-subgit:8.11.0-ee.1-3.0.0:  GitLab v8.11.0 (EE), SubGit v3.0.0

Since September 2016, however, v3.0.0 of SubGit was no longer available; hence, versions after v8.11.2 are build with the then current SubGit version.
