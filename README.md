# gitlab-ee-subgit

Image: [marq/gitlab-ee-subgit](https://hub.docker.com/r/marq/gitlab-ee-subgit/)

[GitLab](http://gitlab.org)'s Enterprise Edition, with [SubGit](http://www.subgit.com) v3.3.5 installed.

All of [GitLab's Docker-related documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/) remains valid; the only difference compared to the [official Docker image(s)](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ee/) provided by GitLabHQ is that this image contains an installation of SubGit, a tool for migrating and even mirroring subversion and git source code repositories. In addition, one more volume (`/etc/subgit`) is exposed, allowing to store SubGit related things like a license key. In addition, the  `cron` daemon is launched, with the corresponding system directory being exposed as an additional volume.

[Subgit's SVN to Gitlab Howto](http://www.subgit.com/gitlab.html) is a worthwhile read.

## Volumes

`/etc/gitlab`: Configuration of the GitLab server

`/var/opt/gitlab`: Repositories

`/var/log/gitlab`: Logfiles

`/etc/subgit`: Location for subgit.key (if available; SubGit will find it there)

`/etc/cron.d`: Location for cron jobs (e.g., backups)

## Usage

For GitLab itself, see http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/.

For SubGit and Gitlab, see http://www.subgit.com/gitlab.html.

In contrast to the original image, the cron daemon is also launched when starting up GitLab. This allows processing of cron jobs added to `/etc/cron.d`, e.g. for performing automated backups.

## Tags

The `:latest` tag is automatically build from the official GitLab repository; that is whenever GitlabHQ decides to push a new (even experimental) image. This mechanism may break, e.g. when the download link to subgit changes, or when the currently being used subgit version isn't available any more. If you find that happening, and don't see it fixed within a few days, please raise a ticket at GitHub. Thanks!

**Note**: I used to create versioned tags manually until (about) GitLab v9.5 in late 2017; they were based on tagged images as available in the official GitLab repository. These tagged (though by now outdated) images are still available on Docker Hub. However, as I lost the need for them, I stopped generating them; only the `:latest` image is currently being generated on a regular basis. If you have a need for tagged images of newer GitLab versions, please raise a ticket at GitHub. Thank you!

## SubGit Versions

Starting with the image for v8.11 of GitLab, the SubGit included in this image is at v3.2.2. For a while, I was maintaining an alternate image with the older v3.0.0 of SubGit included. The images can be distinguished by their tags, e.g.:

    gitlab-ee-subgit:8.11.0-ee.1:        GitLab v8.11.0 (EE), SubGit v3.2.2
    gitlab-ee-subgit:8.11.0-ee.1-3.0.0:  GitLab v8.11.0 (EE), SubGit v3.0.0

Since September 2016, v3.0.0. of SubGit was no longer available; hence, tagged versions after v8.11.2 are available with the then current SubGit version. Starting with GitLab v9.0, SubGit was at v3.2.5, and remained at that version for all (by now outdated) tagged builds.

The `:latest` image started to use SubGit v3.3.5 in January 2019.
